## What it shows

Your AI coding spend says `$50 today`. Which provider was it? Which session?
Which turn? Which sub-agent or tool loop? A daily total can't answer that, so
Lupen breaks the number down and recomputes each cost from the raw tokens.

- **Provider-scoped totals** — `$50 today · Claude Code · 12 sessions · 84 turns`. Claude Code and Codex stay in separate modes instead of one mixed list.
- **Cost per Turn, Step, SkillGroup, and SubAgent**, where the data allows it.
- **Recomputed, then diffed** — each cost is recomputed from raw tokens and the public price table and compared to the reported total, so any difference is shown rather than assumed.
- **Origin-tagged attachments** — every file, image, and URL is labelled by where it entered the context.
- **Sub-agent cost** rolls up into the parent turn and stays attributable on its own.

## Key features

- **Provider mode** — Choose Claude Code or Codex. Lupen shows only that provider's sessions, conversations, dropdown totals, reports, diagnostics, and verification results.
- **Cost drift verification** — Run the **Verify Usage** window to recompute every cost from raw tokens and the public price table, then diff it against the reported total; any difference is flagged. Claude Code is checked against its per-request totals; Codex gets an independent local verifier over rollout `token_count` events.
- **Search and resume** — Full-text search finds a session by any prompt it contains (across every turn), plus its project and slug. Reopen any result in Claude Code (or Codex) to pick up where you left off — Lupen runs `claude --resume` / `codex resume` in a new Terminal window, or copies the command for you.
- **Turn boundaries that match Anthropic's API** — Lupen uses `stop_reason` to mark Turn boundaries instead of timestamps. Tool-use loops stay inside one Turn instead of fragmenting into a dozen rows.
- **Codex rollout support** — Lupen reads `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`, normalizes cached input, preserves reasoning tokens, handles cumulative token deltas, and watches new day folders live.
- **Sub-agent cost rollup** — When a Turn spawns sub-agents, their cost rolls up into the parent in the outline but stays separately attributable in the detail pane. The aggregate and the per-agent figures come from the same source, so they stay consistent.
- **Origin-tagged attachment tracking** — File paths, image bytes, and URLs are classified by where they entered the conversation (inline prompt, tool input, tool output, reply, …) so you can see what's filling the context window.
- **5-hour limit tracking** — A Bayesian estimate of `$ per 1 % of limit consumed` across your last 7 days, surfaced in the menu-bar icon's ring tint (yellow at 70 %, orange at 90 %, red at 100 %).
- **Scriptable `lupen` CLI** — The same app binary is a command line over the same local index: every report as a table, `--json`, or `--csv`, plus `verify` / `budget` exit-code gates for a CI step or commit hook. See [Command line](#command-line).
- **Zero network** — Lupen only reads local Claude Code and Codex files on disk. No API keys, no telemetry, no cloud sync.

## Install

```bash
brew install --cask momoraul/lupen/lupen
```

…or grab the signed DMG from the [latest release](https://github.com/momoraul/Lupen/releases/latest). Both are notarized and keep themselves up to date via Sparkle.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/momoraul/Lupen.git
cd Lupen
cp Config/Local.xcconfig.example Config/Local.xcconfig  # set DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
xcodebuild build -project Lupen.xcodeproj -scheme Lupen -destination 'platform=macOS'
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Lupen-*/Build/Products/Debug/Lupen.app
```

## Command line

The app binary doubles as a `lupen` CLI — same local index the menu-bar app
builds, every report scriptable and local:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/branding/lupen-cli.svg" alt="lupen skills --last 30d — a per-skill cost table with RUNS, COST, $/run, and top model columns" width="620">
</p>

```bash
lupen skills --last 30d            # per-skill cost, $/run, top model
lupen top --by sessions --limit 5  # the costliest sessions
lupen budget --over 20 --last 7d   # exit 4 if this week ran over $20
lupen verify                       # exit 4 if any cost drifts from the recomputed truth
lupen daily --json | jq            # any report as JSON / CSV
```

The full command set, grouped:

| | Commands |
|---|---|
| **Spend** | `summary` (default) · `daily` / `weekly` / `monthly` |
| **Breakdowns** | `skills` · `models` · `projects` · `top` |
| **Find & resume** | `search <text>` · `resume <session-id>` |
| **Guards** (exit-code gates for CI) | `verify` · `budget --over <usd>` · `statusline` |
| **Index & setup** | `refresh` · `config` · `install-cli` |

Every reporting command takes `--provider`, a period (`--last 30d` / `--month
2026-06` / `--since … --until …`), and `--json` / `--csv` — except `verify`,
which audits the whole corpus and ignores the period.

Homebrew installs put `lupen` on your PATH automatically;
on a DMG or source build, run `lupen install-cli` once. Full reference — every
flag and exit code: [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

## Why I built this

A single Claude Code session once cost me more than the rest of the day combined,
and the daily total couldn't tell me which turn — or which runaway sub-agent —
ate the money. Lupen is the itemized receipt I wanted: every turn priced, and
every price checked against the raw tokens, without anything leaving my Mac.

## Privacy

Lupen reads local session files on your Mac:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`
- Codex: `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` or `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`

It makes **zero network requests**. No telemetry, no analytics, no cloud sync.
Your conversations, prompts, file paths, and attachments never leave your
machine. The `Info.plist` carries no `NSAppTransportSecurity` block because
Lupen opens no sockets — you can confirm this with Little Snitch or any
outbound-connection monitor.

Detailed model: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Changelog

### v0.8.1 — _2026-07-05_

A Reports fix for relative date ranges.

- **Reports relative-range fix** — the Skills tab no longer gets stuck when you
  pick a relative date range, and the week range is now a rolling 7 days.

### v0.8.0 — _2026-07-05_

A turn waterfall timeline, recovered parallel tool calls, and a unified cost color.

- **Turn waterfall timeline** — each turn's activity now renders as a swimlane
  timeline you can click to jump into, with instant tooltips.
- **Parallel tool calls recovered** — expanding a turn no longer drops tool calls
  that ran in parallel.
- **Consistent cost color** — the "attention" orange for costs is unified into a
  single token so it reads the same across every surface.

### v0.7.0 — _2026-06-29_

Multiple session sources, weekly/monthly reports, and a faster, friendlier Conversation tab.

- **Multiple session sources** — index Claude Code / Codex sessions from more
  than one root and switch between them; sources are added and managed in
  Settings.
- **Weekly & monthly reports** — the Reports Overview now buckets by Day, Week,
  or Month, each with a period-over-period delta, for long-term trends and
  monthly expense reporting.
- **Appearance setting** — pick System, Light, or Dark independently of macOS.
- **In-conversation Find (⌘F)** — search within the open conversation with match
  navigation and highlighting.
- **Per-card Copy** — every conversation card (and code block) has a
  hover-revealed Copy button with copy confirmation.
- **Menu-bar action menu** — right-click the menu-bar item for quick actions.
- **Self-healing index** — File → Check Index Integrity… runs an on-demand
  SQLite integrity check and repairs a corrupt index in place.
- **Stability** — removed force-unwraps on hot and launch paths so corrupt input
  degrades gracefully instead of crashing the app or CLI.

### v0.6.3 — _2026-06-24_

A calmer Conversation tab and a more reliable menu bar.

- **Conversation tab redesign** — quiet cards (a hairline border + faint fill so
  the dialogue leads instead of competing with boxes), receding headers, and an
  accent-bordered selected step; body typography, reading width, and code/table
  legibility were tuned alongside.
- **Cleaner attachment indicator** — a single legible paperclip marks turns with
  image attachments (instead of one glyph per image), and it stays readable on
  the selected row in both light and dark mode.
- **Menu bar** — clicking the menu-bar item now reliably brings the window to the
  front, and idle days show a clear "$0" instead of a near-invisible dimmed amount.

### v0.6.2 — _2026-06-23_

Urgent CLI crash fix plus more accurate Codex usage verification.

- **CLI crash fix** — the `lupen` CLI no longer crashes on launch (a SIGTRAP
  that hit 100% of CLI runs); logging now bootstraps safely from any thread.
- **Codex Verify Usage accuracy** — stops false-positive "missing usage"
  reports, fixes generated-turn request-id matching, and adds error/warning
  severity to the Verify Costs filter and the `verify` CLI gate.

### v0.6.1 — _2026-06-22_

Fixes a freeze on very large turns and cold-launch selection.

- **Large-turn performance** — the Conversation tab no longer freezes on
  multi-thousand-step turns; long runs of supporting activity (tools, thinking)
  fold into a collapsed group so the card count stays bounded.
- **Cold-launch selection** — the first session is now auto-selected on a cold
  launch with a proper focus ring, instead of opening with nothing selected.

### v0.6.0 — _2026-06-21_

Reimagines the Conversation tab as a rich Turn reader.

- **Conversation rich reader** — a selected Turn now renders as a card stack
  (prompt → thinking → tools → reply) instead of two plain-text blocks, with
  rich markdown (headings, lists, code blocks with copy, tables, quotes) and
  multi-line selection.
- **Curation** — thinking and tool calls collapse into one-line disclosures you
  can expand; interrupted / API-error / compacted turns show a clear status
  banner instead of "(no response available)".
- **Readability** — prompts and replies stand out as cards while side content
  (thinking, tools) fades into indented lines; the selected step is highlighted
  and scrolled into view.

### v0.5.0 — _2026-06-21_

Adds a storage manager and sharpens the Codex sidebar.

- **Manage Sessions & Storage window** (⌘⇧M) — browse and clean up Claude Code
  and Codex sessions by disk usage, with Lupen cache inspection (index / WAL /
  snapshot) and a read-only all-disk view. Deletion is trash-only with an
  allowlist + Undo; auth/config/state files are hard-blocked.
- **Codex first-prompt titles** — sessions without a `session_index.jsonl`
  thread name now show their first user prompt instead of the raw id prefix.
- **Zero-cost session hiding** — low-signal $0 sessions (Codex
  auto-review/guardian, idle) collapse behind a small `(N)` toggle per project
  group; active, selected, and no-cost-aggregate sessions stay visible.
- **Cost recoloring** — cost ≥ $1 reads orange (softer on dark), N/A reads
  slate, sub-$1 stays dim; colors adapt per light/dark and invert on selection.

### v0.4.1 — _2026-06-20_

Maintenance release — cost-accuracy fixes and a clearer cost in the sidebar.

- Per-session cost now has a dedicated, compression-resistant sidebar label —
  the title truncates first so the cost stays visible, with the same confidence
  tinting as the turn rows.
- Codex: sessions backed by valid rollout JSONL now appear in the sidebar even
  when they're missing from `session_index.jsonl`, matching the local Codex view.
- Verify Costs: `usage` blocks that omit input/output tokens are kept (coerced
  to 0) instead of silently dropping the line — fixes an undercount versus the
  ground-truth scan.
- Codex usage verifier: fold `last`-only token events into the running total so
  the verifier matches the importer.
- Codex: bound memory when importing/verifying oversized single-piece rollouts,
  preventing an out-of-memory spike on very large sessions.

### v0.4.0 — _2026-06-18_

First release of the `lupen` command line — the app binary doubles as a
scriptable CLI over the same local index the menu-bar app builds.

- **`lupen` CLI** — `summary`, `daily` / `weekly` / `monthly`, `skills`,
  `models`, `projects`, `top`, `search` / `resume`, `verify`, `budget`,
  `statusline`, `refresh`, `config`, `install-cli`.
- Every report as a table, `--json`, or `--csv`; `--provider` and the period
  flags (`--last` / `--month` / `--since`+`--until`) throughout.
- `verify` (exit 4 on cost drift) and `budget --over` (exit 4) make CI or
  commit-hook cost gates.
- Homebrew installs put `lupen` on your PATH automatically; DMG / source
  builds run `lupen install-cli` once.
- Log window is now a DEBUG-only diagnostic (hidden in release builds).

### v0.3.0 — _2026-06-17_

First public release. Highlights:

- Session → Turn → Step → SkillGroup → SubAgent outline with per-row cost and 4-way token breakdown
- Provider mode for Claude Code and Codex
- Codex rollout JSONL parsing with cached-input normalization, reasoning tokens, cumulative dedup, fork replay handling, and live watching
- `CostVerifier` / `Verify Usage` — provider-aware independent scans for local accounting confidence
- 5-hour-limit tracking with Bayesian shrinkage (`$ per 1 % limit`) and severity-tinted menu-bar icon
- Origin-tagged attachment classification with inline image preview
- Snapshot cache for incremental launch (full reparse only when the schema bumps)
- Sparkle 2 auto-update, with a signed appcast hosted on GitHub Pages
- Status-item rendered as a single attributed run — no icon-text gap on macOS 26
