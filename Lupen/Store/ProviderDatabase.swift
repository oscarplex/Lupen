/// concurrent snapshot readers), busy timeout, schema bootstrap, and the
/// rebuild-on-version-bump policy. The database is a derived cache — the
/// JSONL logs are the source of truth — so a `schema_version` mismatch
/// never migrates: the files are deleted and the schema is bootstrapped
/// fresh, and importers re-index in the background.

/// Module guardrail (plan.md Confirmed Decisions): GRDB types must not
/// leak outside `Lupen/Store/` — repositories expose domain DTOs only.

    /// v3: idx_sessions_page_order expression index (sidebar keyset page).
    /// v4: turns carry full token/cost breakdown columns (4.1 headers).
    /// v5: skills extracted at import (4.4 Reports) — rebuild populates.
    /// v6: sessions.last_git_branch (6.1 sidebar branch row).
    /// v7: subagent_links.parent_assistant_uuid stores the MERGED step
    ///     uuid, not the raw tool_use line's (6.6 graft-join fix —
    ///     streamed thinking+tool_use splits left links pointing at no
    ///     step row, hiding every sub-agent graft in the outline).
    /// v8: prompt_preview/cached_title cap 50 → 300 chars (6.12 — wide
    ///     Conversation columns showed "…" mid-line). Value-only change;
    ///     the bump exists so existing rows re-index with the longer
    ///     preview instead of leaving a 50/300 mix per import age.
    /// v9: search_fts gains source_file_id + an AFTER DELETE trigger on
    ///     source_files (B3 — FTS5 takes no foreign key, so re-imports
    ///     orphaned old FTS rows and double-counted prompt hits). Rebuild
    ///     recreates the virtual table with the new column.
    /// v10: requests INSERT became `ON CONFLICT(id) DO NOTHING`. Behavior-
    ///     only change; the bump forces a rebuild so sessions previously
    ///     parked `failed` by the cross-session `requests.id` collision
    ///     (compact-continuation replays sharing requestIds) re-import and
    ///     recover their conversation + cost.
    /// v11: sessions gain `logical_parent_uuid` + `superseded_by` for
    ///     compact-continuation lineage merging — redundant earlier
    ///     snapshots collapse into the canonical leaf so the sidebar shows
    ///     one session and Verify Costs stops flagging the replay overlap.
    /// v12: new `request_membership` table records the full per-file
    ///     billable requestId list (pre-dedup). The lineage resolver now
    ///     detects replays by requestId SHARING — not `logical_parent_uuid`,
    ///     which `--resume` (a session fork) never writes — so resume/fork
    ///     overlaps collapse to the canonical owner and Verify Costs clears.
    /// v13: `request_membership` excludes sidechains (subagent requestIds no
    ///     longer inflate a parent's owner rank) and carries each file's
    ///     token values, so the re-home rewrites the deduped row to the
    ///     OWNER's tokens + re-finalizes — fixing the residual per-session
    ///     token/cost drift when a replay caught a different usage snapshot.
    /// v14: a transcript that carries its OWN sessionId on some lines is
    ///     attributed to its filename even when the first (replayed) line
    ///     carries the parent's id — so a `--resume` that keeps the parent
    ///     id no longer orphans the resumed session's shell as perpetually
    ///     `partial`. The replayed turns/steps/links such a file re-imports
    ///     for the parent now `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` like requests.
    /// v15: requests INSERT on `ON CONFLICT(id)` now RE-BINDS source_file_id
    ///     to the importing file instead of `DO NOTHING`. A replayed
    ///     requestId's single row was pinned (CASCADE) to whichever file
    ///     imported it first; re-indexing that file deleted the row while
    ///     other carriers only DO-NOTHING'd, so it vanished and `requests`
    ///     drifted behind `request_membership` (Verify Costs flagged the
    ///     billable requestIds as missing). The bump forces a clean rebuild
    ///     so existing drifted rows recover.
    /// v16: parent_links gains a (session_id, parent_uuid) index.
    ///     `turnLineLocators` now walks merged-line chains recursively —
    ///     an assistant message streams one JSONL line per content block,
    ///     so parallel tool_use lines sit ≥2 parent hops from their step
    ///     row and the old one-hop join dropped them from the expand
    ///     re-decode (Conversation tab lost the ToolGroup; timeline lanes
    ///     fell back to "Tool"). The walk seeks children per dequeued row
    ///     and needs the index to stay O(turn).
