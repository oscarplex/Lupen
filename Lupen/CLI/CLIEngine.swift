/// SQLite index the GUI app maintains, optionally refreshes it from the
/// source logs, and exposes its `ProviderStore` (which conforms to
/// `ReportsRepository`) to the subcommands.
///
/// `ProviderDatabase`/`ProviderStore` are `Sendable` and carry no
/// `@MainActor` constraint, so they run fine in a CLI process with no run
/// loop (GRDB is synchronous). The index is just a cache of the raw
/// `~/.claude` / `~/.codex` logs, so the CLI is self-sufficient: it never
/// requires the app to have run — a cold first run builds the index from
/// the logs itself (see `CLIRefresher`).
///
/// Opening the index is itself a write: `ProviderDatabase.open` creates the
/// provider directory and bootstraps (or, on a schema bump, rebuilds) the
/// schema. The refresh that follows populates it; the report queries are
/// read-only. A cross-process lock (`CLIProcessLock`) keeps two concurrent
/// `lupen` refreshes from doing duplicate work.
